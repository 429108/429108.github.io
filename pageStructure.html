        Your HTML web page can use many different tags
        to distinguish what are you trying to express.
        You can use Ordered Lists, these can be used
        for:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Number lists,</li>
        <li>A list which has an ordered structure,</li>
        <li>Countdowns,</li>
        <li>Chronologically ordered tasks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        While ordered lists can be used, sometimes you 
        may find unordered lists to be of use.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unnumbered lists,</li>
        <li>Lists with no specific order to them,</li>
        <li>A display of different items in a list in no particular order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While you can use HTML tags to write lists, 
        you can also use them to write...
    </p>
    <h1>Headers.</h1>
    <p>
        As seen above, they can be a large header...
    </p>
    <h2>A medium header</h2>
    <p>
        Or a...
    </p>
    <h3>Small header</h3>
    <h4>And can get</h4>
    <h5>increadingly</h5>
    <h6>smaller (smallest header possible h6)</h6>
    <p>
        Another tag you can use is &lt;b> to make your text <b>bold.</b>
    </p>
